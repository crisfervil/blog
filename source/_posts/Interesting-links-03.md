- [Bye-bye Python. Hello Julia](https://towardsdatascience.com/bye-bye-python-hello-julia-9230bff0df62) : [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a new programming language that sounds very promising. But I honestly don't believe Python is going to disappear from the stage that easily.

- [Code Generators in c#](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators) :  An interesting new feature available in c# that allows you to generate code in build time, and potentially to modify the existing code.

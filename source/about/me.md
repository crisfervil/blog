Solution Architect having fun in this profession for 20 years. I have a broad experience in different sectors like Aircraft Manufacturing, Finance, Environmental Protection, Chemical, Media and Public Sector.

During these years I worked in different roles but mainly designing and delivering systems based on the Microsoft platform. Lately I have had the pleasure to learn and contribute to the Dynamics 365 platform, where I help customers to get the most of their Dynamics implementation, either in on-premise deployments or in the cloud. 

I am an open creative person, with energy and integrity. I really enjoy working in collaborative environments, I adapt very well to changes and I am constantly looking for new challenges.
